### Accessing the Admin Dashboard
To view the admin dashboard in the Grand Coffee System, you can manually set your user role to 'admin' in the local storage. Here's how:

1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Use your browser's developer tools to access the local storage (usually found under the Application tab).
3. Modify the `userRole` key (or similar) to the value `admin`.
4. Refresh the page, and you should see an admin icon in the navbar, allowing access to the admin dashboard.

This is intended for development and testing purposes only.
